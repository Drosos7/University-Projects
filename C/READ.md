This repository represents my Semester 1 Roadmap, documenting the transition from core programming logic to practical C implementation.
A comprehensive collection of 101 programs developed within 30 days. This roadmap showcases my daily progress, starting from basic syntax and evolving into complex management systems.
The Archives (70+ Programs): Foundational exercises and lab sheets covering loops, arrays, and basic logic.
The Highlights (31 Programs): Featured projects focusing on memory management, file handling, and structured data organization.
